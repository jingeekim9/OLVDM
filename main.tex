%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   This assignment is intended to practice your technical paper writing skills. You are about to write three pages of technical paper, excluding extra space for the references. This is a space for the abstract. The abstract is intended to introduce a brief idea of your work and some summary of the experimental results. Now you can guess what texts should be placed in this section: describe a summary of your work, explain why the project is essential, explain what problem you are solving, describe how did you implement, and how it is distinguishable compared to the baseline approaches. The abstract should be concise, so try to make it to be 10 to 15 lines.
\end{abstract}
