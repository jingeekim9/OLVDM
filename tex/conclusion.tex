\section{Conclusion}

This section describes a quick summary of your work and take-home message from the experiment. Please do not try to reuse texts from abstract because it is redundant. Any discussion for future work would be great instead.

Here is an example. "In this work, we proposed a new algorithm for blabla tasks. The key idea is to introduce blabla to the existing network. Experimental results show that our approach surpasses the prior works. As future work, we are improving blabla part of our pipeline to extend our work to blabla task."
