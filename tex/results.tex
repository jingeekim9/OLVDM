\section{Results}

It is always great to show something interesting to other people. In this section, you are showing your results. Please put anything you would like to show, such as images, tables, charts, graphs. Remember, just putting results does not end up with a successful paper. What you need to achieve in this section is to provide an \emph{analysis}. If you have excellent results, please describe why it happens. Sometimes, to justify the arguments, an ablation study needs to be performed. For instance, if you have multiple loss functions in your neural network, you produce many results using some of the loss functions intentionally and see the results. In this procedure, you can find what loss function contributes the most to the task.

In this section, you can also compare your results with other methods to justify your arguments. Remember, you had mentioned the pros and cons of the earlier approaches and explained the benefit of the proposed approach in previous sections. By showing comparison with baseline approaches, you can show a \emph{proof} saying that your argument is correct and valid. Remember the arguments regarding the results should be consistent throughout the paper.
